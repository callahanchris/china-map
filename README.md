# China Map

This is a small side project I put together with the goal of making an interactive JavaScript map of China. The map is a [jVectorMap](http://jvectormap.com/), and the data comes from the Wikipedia articles on each Chinese province.

# Application Setup

* Run `bundle`

* Run `rake db:migrate`

* Run `rake db:seed` to populate the database

* Boot up the server with `rails s`

* Visit `localhost:3000` to view the map

* Mouse over a province to see more information about it!
